## Ubiquitous language

>A ubiquitous language is a (semi-)formal language that is shared by all members of a software development team â€” both software developers and non-technical personnel. The language in question is both used and developed by all team members as a common means of discussing the domain of the software in question. In this way BDD becomes a vehicle for communication between all the different roles in a software project.
