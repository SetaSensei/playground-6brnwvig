`BDD` inhjerits from the `Test Driven Developement` process :

* Define what the tests should verify
* Ensure the test is failing
* Implement the code that will validate the test
* Ensure the test is not failing anymore

The team should thrive to define the expected behaviours of their system before developing them.

As we are talking team-wise, we need to describes a behaviour in a language that any human can understand and that follows the guidelines TDD gives us.

## BDD is not only Cucumber

`Cucumber` is one of Java's framework to work in `BDD`.
You may have heard of `Specflow` for .net.

In order to work, `Cucumber` and `Specflow` both rely on `Gherkin`.
